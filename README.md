A small project to explore terminals and light networking code. 

Not intended to be multiplatform, only works on Windows.
Only works in a windows terminal (CMD and POWERSHELL are not true valid terminals, Windows is a strange beast). Windows has released Windows Terminal to emulate a true terminal experience, and was what I primarily used for testing. Although the terminal in VSCode has all the features required for a terminal, and therefore also runs the program correctly!
